today - expressions and control flow

expression is just something that has value

control structures are based on booleans
to create booleans you need comparison or logical operators
comparison == != === < > >= <=

logical ? | && :

undefined is the same as false: if(!x) 

literal - a number or a string
expressions are literals or variables and combinations thereof


identify problem then come up with an algorithm to solve

there will be tasks that need to be repeated

loops repeat tasks

conditonals decide path of actions

changing a tire is perfect way to illustrate the above

loosen lugnuts
jack car up
take lugnuts off

''          empty string
0           zero
NaN         Not a number
undefined   undefined
null        null
false       false

^^all of the above evaluate to false as logical expressions; everything else is true

COMPARISON operators

Equality

(= is not an equals it's the assignment operator)

==          abstract equals = evaluates just the value
===         strict equals   - evalutes value and type

always use strict when you're starting out as a best practice

floating point
